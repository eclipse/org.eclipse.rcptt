** About
   Set of shell scripts to be executed on http://hudson.eclipse.org/rcptt to publish nightly and release builds to rcptt download area. Layout suggested below is not final, but we need something to begin with.

** Nightly builds
   #+BEGIN_SRC fundamental
     # RCPs:
     /nightly/1.5.2/{qualifier}/ide/rcptt.ide-1.5.2-N{qualifier}-{platform}.zip

     # Main repo & runtime repos
     /nightly/1.5.2/{qualifier}/repository/
     /nightly/1.5.2/{qualifier}/full/repository/
     /nightly/1.5.2/{qualifier}/runtime4x/

     # Latest (just a copy with minor change in ide file (to ensure url is the same))
     /nightly/1.5.2/latest/ide/rcptt.ide-1.5.2-nightly-{platform}.zip
     /nightly/1.5.2/latest/repository/
     /nightly/1.5.2/latest/runtime4x/
   #+END_SRC

   So if at some point we are going to have more than one version in active development, we can easily distinguish between different streams

** Release builds
   
   To be described
