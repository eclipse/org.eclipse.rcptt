Contributing to RCP Testing Tool
================================

Thanks for your interest in this project.

Project description:
--------------------

RCP Testing Tool allows create and execute test cases for Eclipse-based applications with minimal effort. The minimal required configuration of applications under test is as simple as browsing for a folder for binary AUTs or choosing a PDE launch configuration for AUTs from sources. A typical workflow to create a test case which should work in most cases looks like this: capture an application state, record test actions, add assertions. More complex activities including test parameterization, extracting common pieces of functionality into reusable actions, writing test cases manually before UI, and test case debugging are also available. Developers can extend the tool&#39;s functionality to add record/replay support of custom widgets and capture/apply support of custom aspects of an application state.
